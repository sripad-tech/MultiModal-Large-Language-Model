Imagebind is a Meta AI open source MultiModal Large Language Model which is used to produce embeddings of Image, Audio, Depth, Sensors, Video, Text etc. Image is bound to all other 
modalities which makes the model even better in terms of cross modal retrieval perfomance, ensuring retrieval of audio from image and vice-versa.
Cross-modal retrieval of Multimodal Large Language Model was used with Shared Embedding Spaces for Classification of Alzheimers and Cognitive normal patients.
The initial paper demonstrated a novel InfoNCE loss, but we combined the ability of InfoNCE along with Cross Entropy loss to accurately predict the Dementiated Patients
using MRI and CT Scans as input image modality and Alzheimers Aphasia Speech Conversations in .wav files.
